/* In Dart, the 'late' keyword is used to indicate that a variable will be 
initialized later, before it is accessed for the first time. It is particularly 
useful in scenarios where you need to declare a non-nullable variable that cannot 
be initialized immediately upon declaration, such as when initializing a variable 
in a constructor or when the initialization depends on asynchronous operations. */

// Here's how the 'late' keyword works:

/* 1. Declaration: When you declare a variable using the 'late' keyword, you are 
essentially telling Dart that the variable will be assigned a value before it is 
accessed for the first time. You still need to specify the type of the variable. */
late int lateVariable;

/* 2. Initialization: You can assign a value to a 'late' variable later in the code, 
but before you try to access it. Dart will enforce this constraint and throw an 
error if you try to access a late variable before it's initialized. */
void initializeLateVariable() {
  lateVariable = 42;
}

/* 3. Accessing the Variable: Once the 'late' variable is initialized, 
you can access it like any other variable of its type. */
void main() {
  initializeLateVariable();
  print(lateVariable); // Prints: 42
}

/* 4. Error Handling: If you try to access a 'late' variable before 
it's initialized, Dart will throw a LateInitializationError. This helps catch 
potential bugs early in development. */

/* 5. Usage: 'late' variables are particularly useful when working with 
dependency injection, Flutter widgets, or any situation where you need to initialize 
a variable asynchronously, such as fetching data from a network or reading from a file. */

/* 6. Nullable Safety: With Dart's null safety feature, 'late' variables cannot 
be null once they're initialized, making them different from regular nullable 
variables. This helps enforce safer coding practices and eliminates the need 
for null checks on these variables once they're initialized. */

/* Overall, the 'late' keyword in Dart provides a way to declare non-nullable variables 
that can be initialized later in the code, ensuring that they are initialized before 
they are accessed and helping catch potential null pointer exceptions early in development. */
