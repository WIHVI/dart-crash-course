/* In Dart, the 'late' keyword is used to indicate that a variable
 will be initialized at a later point in time, after its declaration. 
 This is particularly useful when dealing with non-nullable variables 
 that cannot be assigned null and must be initialized before they are used. 
 The 'late' keyword allows you to postpone the initialization of such variables
 until they are actually needed. */

// Here's a comprehensive explanation of how 'late' works in Dart:
/* 1. Non-nullable by default: 
 Dart introduced null safety, which means that variables are non-nullable by default. 
 This ensures that variables cannot be null unless explicitly declared with a '?' modifier. */

/* 2. Initialization requirement: 
 Non-nullable variables must be initialized before they are accessed, 
 otherwise, the Dart compiler will raise an error. */

/* 3. Lazy initialization with 'late': 
 The 'late' keyword allows you to declare a non-nullable variable without initializing it immediately. 
 Instead, you promise to initialize it before it is accessed for the first time. */

/* 4. When to use 'late': You should use the 'late' keyword when you have a 
 situation where it's not possible or convenient to initialize a variable 
 immediately, but you are confident that it will be initialized before it's used. */

/* 5. Error handling: If you fail to initialize a 'late' variable before 
 it's accessed, Dart will throw a 'LateInitializationError' at runtime. 
 This error indicates that you accessed a late variable before it was initialized. */

/* 6. Initialization context: The initialization of 'late' variables can occur in constructors, 
 initializer lists, or methods, as long as it happens before the variable is accessed. */

// Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of 'late' in Dart:

class Example {
  late String lateInitializedString;

  Example(String initialize) {
    // Initializing the lateInitializedString before it's accessed
    lateInitializedString = initialize;
  }

  void useLateInitializedString() {
    print(lateInitializedString);
  }
}

void main() {
  var example = Example('Initialized!');
  example.useLateInitializedString(); // Output: Initialized!
}
